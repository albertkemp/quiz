        <h2>WWII essay:</h2>
        <p>
            WWII - often known as the deadliest war, was a major worldwide conflict involving almost every part of the world. In the years 1939-45, the Axis powers (Germany, Italy, Japan) were against the allied powers (France, Britain, USA, Soviet Union, etc.). 
Extending the power of the Soviet Union to control eastern Europe, WWII was launched when Germany (currently under Hitler rule) attempted to occupy Poland (an ally of Britain and France).

The western third of Poland went to Germany while the other two thirds went to the USSR. Now that Germany had claimed a portion of Poland, Germany suspected they had the clear to invade without Allied interference, so Hitler gave orders for the attack to be launched on August 26.

Unfortunately for Hitler, France and Britain declared war on Germany after the invasion on Poland. Although France, Britain and Poland were against Germany combined, Germany had one of the most powerful and efficient militaries of the time and proved a hard opponent to beat. Germany also possessed the most powerful air force of the time, the Luftwaffe.

After many attacks, battles and invasions Germany finally succumbed to the Allied powers.
